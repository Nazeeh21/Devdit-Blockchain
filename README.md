# Devdit (https://devdit-blockchain.vercel.app/)

- Devdit is a decentralized platform which provides an environment for developers to post updates about the new teck stacks and to post developer's kindoff stuff.

- Devdit stores the user's data entirely on the blockchain. It uses Ethereum Smart Contract written in Solidity.

## Tech stack used for storing data (on the Blockchain)

- `Ethereum Smart Contracts`
- `Solidity`
- `Hardhat`
- `Truffle`
- `Web3`
- `Ethers`
- `Mocha`
- `Chai`

* Smart Contract is compiled using the `Hardhat` library which provides `Ethers` for compiling the Contract.

* Tests for the Contract are written using `Chai` and provider of `Ethers`.

* Contract deployed on Rinkeby test network using `Ethers` and `Infura` node.

* Local Instance of Contract deployed using `Web3.js`.

## Teck stack used for frontend

- `Nextjs`
- `TypeScript`
- `ChakraUI`
- `Formik`

### Frontend deployed using [Versel](https://vercel.com/)

### Ethereum Smart Contract deployed on the Rinkeby Test network using Infura node.
